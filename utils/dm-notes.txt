# Should write notes, not stories here ...

After waking up on the boat, their ships got attacked by pirates, found a treasure map and convinced the gladiator Mako and two soldiers to follow them to the treasure. They took one of the ships, and left at nightfall. Once reaching the land, they soon found themselves in a sandstorm, which was the result of approaching bandits. After disclosing that they were on on the same side as the King, the bandits offered to make trade with them. Ga'Ri bought a sandstorm dagger, Cyrus bought valuable information about the treasure and as the bandits were leaving, Sirrto stole the Sandstorm in a Bottle.

They eventually did reach the temple, and entered it as soon as the moon was full. Here they found three Rings of Poision Resistance, and treassure enough to suffice the party. They ended the day resting outside the temple.
